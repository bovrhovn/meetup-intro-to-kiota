# Meetup intro to Kiota

Demo repository about [Microsoft Kiota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openapi/kiota/overview) for .NET meetup in
Vilnius. Kiota is a command line tool for generating an API client to call any OpenAPI-described API you're interested
in. 

![Kiota Design Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openapi/kiota/images/designoverview.png)

The goal is to eliminate the need to take a dependency on a different API client library for every API that you need
to call. Kiota API clients provide a strongly typed experience with all the features you expect from a high quality API
SDK, but without having to learn a new library for every HTTP API.
